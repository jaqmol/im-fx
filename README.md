# Immutable FX (IM-FX)

Immutable functional reactive programming micro-extension to [React](https://reactjs.org/) covering:

- A real single immutable state tree
- Pure functional reactive components
- Built with async in mind
- Concepts to reduce LOCs in real world apps

## Immutable State Tree,

based on [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) and the concept of key-path-observation. Compared to react-redux, greatly reduces LOCs for passing around action handlers, as well as reducers.

## Facade,

based on React higher-order components. Directly bind properties of functional React components to state-tree values via key-paths. No cumbersome container components, no class based components, fewer LOCs.

## Routing,

is concise, centralised, expressive and clean. On purpose, IM-FX routing is not polluting your JSX.

## Based On

- ImmutableJS
- React
- ReactScripts
- RouteParser
